ðŸŒ¿ I'm a Computer Science student still trying to figure out which area I belong to, and that's my personal account to share my progress.
<br><br>
ðŸ“– I have 2 years of internship experience with data analysis and 1 year of experience with Low-Code/No-Code development using Power Apps and Power Automate. I also know a bit of Quickbase too.
<br><br>
ðŸª¼ Now I've started my Back-End development studies and am very interested in being a Full-Stack dev someday.
